# Site checker

This toolkit includes several Python scripts designed for analyzing and gathering information from websites and subdomains. Each script serves a specific purpose, helping users with a range of tasks from basic site reachability checks to detailed subdomain enumeration with screenshot capturing.

## 1. Site Checker

The `site_checker.py` script performs the following tasks:

- **Reading Hostnames**: Reads a list of hostnames from a file named `hostnames.txt`, with each hostname listed on a separate line.
- **Checking Host Reachability**: Checks if each hostname is reachable by attempting to establish a connection on port 443 (HTTPS) using the `socket` module.
- **Retrieving WHOIS Information**: For reachable hostnames, retrieves WHOIS information using the `whois` library, including details such as the domain name, registrar, creation date, expiration date, status, and contact emails.
- **Fetching SSL Details**: Retrieves SSL certificate details for reachable hostnames using the `ssl` module, including the certificate in PEM format.
- **Capturing HTTP Headers**: Fetches HTTP headers from the hostnames using the `requests` library, providing information such as the server type, content type, and cache control directives.
- **Taking Screenshots**: For reachable hostnames, uses Selenium WebDriver to open the website in a headless Firefox browser and capture a screenshot after waiting for the page to fully load.
- **Outputting Results**: The gathered information for each hostname is saved into a single text file named `results.txt`, including details such as WHOIS information, SSL details, HTTP headers, and paths to screenshots.
- **Creating Output Directory**: Before saving the results, the script creates an output directory named `output` if it doesn't already exist.
- **Handling Errors**: Includes error handling to manage cases where hostnames cannot be reached or where information retrieval fails.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `whois`, `requests`, `selenium`
- Geckodriver executable (geckodriver.exe)

### Usage

1. **Prepare Hostname List**: Create a text file named `hostnames.txt` containing the list of hostnames you want to analyze. Each hostname should be on a separate line.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by running the following command:
   ```bash
   python site_checker.py
   ```

## 2. Subdomain Enumerator

The `subdomain_enumerator.py` script enumerates subdomains for a given domain by leveraging a dictionary attack approach. It performs the following tasks:

- **Choosing a Dictionary File**: Allows the user to select a dictionary file from the `lists` directory containing potential subdomains.
- **Reading Subdomains**: Reads subdomains from the selected dictionary file.
- **Processing Subdomains**: Checks reachability of each subdomain, retrieves WHOIS information, SSL details, and takes screenshots of reachable subdomains.
- **Outputting Results**: Saves the gathered information for each subdomain into separate text files and screenshots into the `subdomain_results` directory.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `requests`, `selenium`, `whois`
- Geckodriver executable (geckodriver.exe)

### Usage

1. **Prepare Domain and Dictionary**: Run the script with the target domain as a command-line argument, e.g.:
   ```bash
   python subdomain_enumerator.py example.com
   ```
   The script will prompt you to choose a dictionary file from the `lists` directory.

## 3. Domain Analysis

The `domain_analysis.py` script takes in a list of domains from an input file and performs DNS reconnaissance, WHOIS lookup, and NSLOOKUP for each domain. It then writes the output to a new file called `list-output.txt`.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `argparse`, `subprocess`, `re`

### Usage

Run the script with the input file containing the list of domains as a command-line argument, e.g.:
   ```bash
   python domain_analysis.py list.txt
   ```
   Replace `list.txt` with the path to your input file containing the list of domains.
